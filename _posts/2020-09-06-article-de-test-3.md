# Super article de test 

## sous-titre

Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! What about the reality where Hitler cured cancer, Morty? The answer is: Don't think about it. Pluto's a planet. What, cover me in gasoline and spiders? Fine, yeah, I'm in.

Earth's going tah tah. You might wanna do that thing where you find a new universe where you can suck yourself off. You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games? This is it, Morty! It's full circle from the pilot! Full circle! … Oh, I guess we, uh… I guess we both just had to take a shit. Nice one, Ms Pancakes.

Sorry I didn't listen to you and tried to kill the whole world and stuff. Guess I gotta learn how to live in the moment a little more. Slow down! There is no god, Summer; gotta rip that band-aid off now you'll thank me later. You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games?

Your failures are your own, old man! I say, follow throooough! Wha, me irresponsible ?! All I wanted you to do was to hand me a screwdriver, Morty! You sold a gun to a murderer so you could play video games? I'm a bit of a stickler Meeseeks, what about your short game?

Oh god, oh, I blame myself. Oh, what a tragedy. Oh, well, he's bones now. I guess all debts are paid. And that's why I always say 'Shumshumschilpiddydah!' Awww, it's you guys! I'll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin' into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue.

You look it up, you don't- you don't even know what it means. Oh, it gets darker, Morty. Welcome to the darkest year of our adventures. First thing that's different? No more dad, Morty. Get off the high road Summer. We all got pink eye because you wouldn't stop texting on the toilet. You gave them proof that there was something bigger and scarier to unite against, you little idiot! They would have gone back into the Dark Ages for a couple of generations, but instead, they dedicated themselves into making universe-destroying, un-thought-out technology like time travel all so they could try to kill a little shitsack on Earth who couldn't let a dead snake be dead even after it bit his ankle!

Because I don't respect therapy; because I'm a scientist; because I invent, transform, create, and destroy for a living, and when I don't like something about the world, I change it. And I don't think going to a rented office in a strip mall to listen to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feelings has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it's helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking, which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I'm not a cow, I'm a pickle... when I feel like it. If you break the rules, try to leave or lose the game, you will die. Just like Saaaaw. Listen to your sister Morty; to live is to risk it all; otherwise you're just an inert chunk of randomly assembled molecules drifting wherever the universe blows you. Oh, I'm sorry, Jerry, I didn't see you there, how much of that did you hear? I'll tell you how I feel about school, Jerry. It's a waste of time. Bunch of people runnin' around bumpin' into each other, got a guy up front says, '2 + 2,' and the people in the back say, '4.' Then the bell rings and they give you a carton of milk and a piece of paper that says you can go take a dump or somethin'. I mean, it's not a place for smart people, Jerry. I know that's not a popular opinion, but that's my two cents on the issue.
